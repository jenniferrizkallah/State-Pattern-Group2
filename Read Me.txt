The "DataFx" file contains the GUI code and all the events mapped to it. Inside of it is the "Executable Program" file which contains the 
executable application. (Note as previously mentioned , errors might be faced while launching it relating to your
JVE and JNI versions and paths , and also their compatibility with the JavaFx library used.)

The "Data Project Support Gui Code" files contains the altered methods of the main code , since the GUI is not compatible
with certain returns and updating the scene multiple times and also needed different returns from the code.

The "Data Project Main" contains the main methods and codes for each of the 3 states. Run the "Main.java" class to access
our personal Eclipse UI which serves to show more behind the scenes of what our code does and what each commands outputs.
This was made due to the GUIs limited event complexity , and because some outputs logically should not be displayed on an
interface (however they are important to show you as an instructor to better understand the code.)
